# Strategy Game

A Java CLI game, based on a academic project from Program Language II class. 

## Motivation

The Java language is very dense, very verbose and full of peculiarities. With this game, our objective is to understand all the dynamics and basic principles of Java, focused only on good principles of OOP using only the Java 8 built in capabilities.

- encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- abstraction

## Goal

At the end of this project, we expect a local strategy game with the possibility of one or two players playing. Besides that, we want to implement a simple AI capable to play the game with a certain level of difficulty ~~and maybe a lan multiplayer option~~.
